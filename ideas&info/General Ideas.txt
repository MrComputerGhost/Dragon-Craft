to open the portal to the dragon's dimension you must have a 5x5x1 ring of gold block with a (ender) dragon's egg in the center. then you have to toss one of every scale into the ring, and the portal opens, teleporting you to the only "safe" island, a 20x20x3 floating island of bed rock.
All dragon biomes only occur once every few hundered biomes. In the dragons dimension, they occur with equal chances too eachother, and only biomes that contain dragons may spawn.
There will be Dragon breeding. To breed Dragons, you must first tame them, then craft a breeding toool. It is crafted with two stciks in the bottom center and the center, and any aount of raw fish in the top center. However many raw fish yu put in thats how much durabillity it has. Every Dragon
takes two durabillity from the breeding wand. Right click on two dragons to breed them. Breeding them will be like tree crossing in Twilight forest. each attribute (listed later) will have a 75% chance of being taken from a parent, a 20% chance of being a blend of the two parents, and a 5% chance of being completly random. The attributes are: Type of dragon(Yes, this can blend), attack, health, speed, strength, agr/passive/netural (baby dragons cant attack until grown, but are not auto tamed), time taken until grown up, amount of food needed to tame.
